# Tier 3 Test Program

# Be sure $0 = 0.

# This should calculate n*(n+1) for whatever immediate value is

# in the first instruction.

# Initialize $1 with the value of n
 
addiu $1, $0, #5
	//0
# Calculate n+1
 
addi $2, $1, 1
		//1
# Calculate n*(n+1)

# First, copy n from $1 to $6 as a counter.
 
andi $6, $1, 255
	//2
# Subtract 1
 
addi $6, $6, -1		//3
# Initialize first partial product
 
addiu $4, $2, 0
		//4
# Add $2 to $4 as another partial product
 
add $4, $4, $2
		//5
# Decrement the counter
 
addi $6, $6, -1		//6
# Compare the count to 0 and loop back to (add $4, $4, $2
) 
bne $0, $6, -3		//7
# Store the result
 
sw $4, 4($0)
		//8
